# Operationalizing Machine Learning

In this project I have registered the dataset and then run autoML on that dataset after that I have deployed the best performing model. Then I have enabled insight logs against the endpoint and then try to consume that endpoint. I also performed some loaded testing and created a dashboard using swagger.

## Key Steps
1. Create an experiment using AutoML, register the dataset, configure a compute cluster, and use that cluster to run the experiment. On successfull completion best performing model will be returned.

2. Then Deploy the best performing model.
3. Then Enable Log insights of the endpoint.
